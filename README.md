# filecryptor
Simple, per item encryption application in Qt for Linux. Just wanted a simple app with AES-256 encryption code to encrypt individual items so here one is. Not too interested in an entire disk encryption scheme, lots of solutions for that. Plus I get to pick the encryption code. Was planning on porting to the NDK but I need to translate some x86 assembly to Android's NEON instruction set, will take more time and research.
